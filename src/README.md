## Description
I created a game of sorts that allows the player to choose between playing
an animation of snowfall or rainfall. I created the raindrop and the landscape
for the snowfall so i will use the images instead of a pygame surface or shape.

- Snowfall.py
	- An image of a snowflake that I will design in Illustrator will be called
  and added into the screen. It will appear multiple times and they will move
  across the screen. They will appear at random positions and be random sizes
  and levels of opacity. They will float slowly and in swirlly motions.
- Rainfall.py
	- An image of a raindrop that I will design in Illustrator will be called and
  added into the screen. It will appear multiple times and they will move
  across the screen. They will appear at random positions and be random sizes
  and levels of opacity. They will fall quicker than the snow and in one 
  direction down.
- main.py
	- The screen will open with text reading 'Welcome to Rain or Snow: for Rain
  press r and for Snow press s'. Pressing the 'r' will call and play the
  rainfall animation and pressing the 's' will call and play the snowfall
  animation.
