# Rain or Snow

## Repository
<https://github.com/lilygannon/pfda_finalProject_GannonLily.git>

## Description
I will create a game of sorts that allows the player to choose between playing
an animation of snowfall or rainfall. I will create the snowflake and raindrop
so i will use the images instead of a pygame surface or shape

## Features
- Snowflake Animation
	- An image of a snowflake that I will design in Illustrator will be called
  and added into the screen. It will appear multiple times and they will move
  across the screen. They will appear at random positions and be random sizes
  and levels of opacity. They will float slowly and in swirlly motions
- Rainfall Animation
	- An image of a raindrop that I will design in Illustrator will be called and
  added into the screen. It will appear multiple times and they will move
  across the screen. They will appear at random positions and be random sizes
  and levels of opacity. They will fall quicker than the snow and in one 
  direction down.
- Game Feature
	- The screen will open with text reading 'Wellcome to Rain or Snow: for Rain
  press r and for Snow press s'. Pressing the 'r' will call and play the
  rainfall animation and pressing the 's' will call and play the snowfall
  animation

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- Make the background trandparent and save a .mp4 of the animation so that it
could be used in larger animation projects

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- A simple game where if you press 's' you get a snowfall animation and if you
press 'r' you get a rainfall animation

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Create the raindrop and snowflake images
  2. Start working on how to call images for the pygame screen moving

- Week 2
  1. Create the snowfall animation
  2. Create the rainfall animation

- Week N (Final)
  1. Create the game function.
  2. Tidy up the code and project folders. Make sure I have all of my
  deliverables
